#summary DB9 pin specifications for sensors.

= 5TE Sensor =

The 5TE sensor measures Electrical Conductivity, Moisture and Temperature. It measures EC in the range of 0 to 23dS/m and temperature in the range of -40 to 50 °C. The resolution of the EC is 0.01 dS/m from 0 to 7 dS/m and 0.05 dS/m from 7 to 23 dS/m. The resolution of the temperature is 0.1 °C. The pin outs for the db9 plug for this sensor is given below
