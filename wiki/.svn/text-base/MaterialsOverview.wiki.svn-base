#summary Descriptions of the materials used in vehicle construction

= Introduction =

This page contains notes on working with some of the materials that have been used in boat construction.

= Marine Foam =

  * Do not expose to silicone while casting.
  * When using a polyethylene mold, use carnauba wax mold release compound.
  * When using a polypropylene mold, no release compound appears necessary.

= Plastics =

== Polycarbonate (OtterBox) ==
  * Cannot be lasercut: attempts required multiple passes and caused superficial burns over the surface of the box.
  * CNC milling is the better strategy.

= Acrylic = 
  * When laser-cutting sliding contact surfaces, leave extra clearance.

= Delrin =
  * Do not use in components that should be glued.

= ABS =
  * Not UV-resistant by default, ensure stock is UV-stabilized.
