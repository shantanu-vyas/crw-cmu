This project contains firmware for an Arduino that uploads new settings to 
the DFR Bluetooth Serial module that allows transparent communication
at 115200, 8-N-1.

Instructions:
1) With no bluetooth device connected, flash the Arduino with this firmware.
2) Turn off the Arduino, disconnect USB and connect the bluetooth adapter.
3) Turn the AT switch to the ON position, then power up the Arduino.
4) The LED (pin13) on the Arduino will turn green if programming succeeded.
